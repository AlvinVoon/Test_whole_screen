        <div class="column">
          <p>Environmental conservation is the protection, preservation, management, or restoration of natural environments and the ecological communities that inhabit them. Conservation is generally held to include the management of human use of natural resources for current public benefit and sustainable social and economic utilization.</p>
          <p>Human existence is quite impossible without the presence of a healthy ecosystem. Our environment comprises all living and non-living components and their interactions within a natural habitat. Environmental conservation has become one of the core issues that need to be addressed to battle climate change and global warming. </p>

            <p>Agriculture relies on the environment. A country’s wealth could be measured on its ability to feed its people. Conserving the environment, with regards to agriculture, could mean preventing soil erosion, flooding and desertification, and could help its citizen have something to eat.</p>

            <title>Importance to the climate
            </title>
            <p>Climate change is a result of human activities and has been linked to excess rainfall, extreme weather and a change in regular weather patterns. Conserving natural environments should be done to see these extreme outcomes reversed, making the world a better place.

            <p>A conserved environment preserves biodiversity. It preserves water and land-based ecosystems, preserves energy flow throughout the biosphere, provides for natural services, preserves food webs, and boosts nature-based tourism.

            <p>Environmental conservation protects wildlife and promotes biodiversity. Maintaining a healthy and functional ecosystem helps prevent the extinction of certain animal species.

            </title>
            <p>Environmental conservation definitely protects and safeguards the environment from certain factors that are wrecking the planet, such as climate change. We need to reduce the amount of harm we are inflicting on the planet as it is contributing to its destruction.

            <p>Environmental conservation will in turn protect and improve human lives and health. If the environment is destroyed, new diseases emerge, and species that could help produce medicines are destroyed. Wild habitats are particularly important as they prevent emerging infectious diseases from jumping from animals to humans.

          <div class="divider2"></div>
          <p style="text-align:center;">Here are some methods that can be effectively facilitated:</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column-3">
          <h4 style="text-align:center;">Forest conservation</h4>
          <p>Afforestation is amongst the core Environmental conservation and aims to plant more trees as well as save the existing ones from cutting down as trees play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-3">
          <h4 style="text-align:center;">Soil conservation</h4>
          <p>Soil conservation can be carried out by ensuring minimal use of fertilizers and venomous chemicals as well as abolishing the disposal of harmful industrial waste in the soil. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-3">
          <h4 style="text-align:center;">Waste management</h4>
          <p>Improper disposal of waste segregation can lead to various dreadful diseases as well as soil pollution. To ensure minimal wastage as well as facilitate waste disposal, we can opt for various techniques like the 3R’s, i.e. Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, dry and wet waste segregation, amongst others.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-3">
          <h4 style="text-align:center;">Public awareness</h4>
          <p>With the boom of information technology and the advent of digital media, public awareness pertaining to environmental conservation can potentially yield promising results. There is a dire need to aware the masses of the consequences of environmental pollution and degradation. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-3">
          <h4 style="text-align:center;">Pollution control</h4>
          <p>As the increase in temperature is concerning, there is a need to keep a watch on the toxic compounds we ingest that pollute the atmosphere. We need to adopt environmentally sustainable methods to minimise multiple forms of emissions, such as eliminating waste, saving electricity, limiting the unnecessary usage of fertilisers, etc.</p>
